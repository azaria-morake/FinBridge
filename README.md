FinBridge is a FinTech platform that aims to help SMMEs get access to financial inclusivity. The first phase of this project is just a simple landing page with a dashboard upon user registration. It uses React for the frontend and Django with MongoDB on the backend. The simplicity route is to make sure that the backend corresponds well with the frontend for testing purposes. From here, more features and pages will be added.
